        ntttest - Build NT test sources
          Win64 - Build for Win64 target
                   if on x86 and amd64 defined, build for amd64

    no_binaries - disable creation of the binaries<sepchar><arch><buildtype> dir.
   binaries_dir - must specify <basepath> immediately after this switch.
                   Use specified path as binplace dir instead of default.
                   Default value is "binaries".

                   the binaries_dir and the arch.  Default value is "."
                   Useful for putting binaries under a common parent
                   directory using '\' (don't specify the quotes).

  officialbuild - Build as one of the official build machines for this branch.
                   The machine and build type must be identified in
                    D:\xpsp1\tools\BuildMachines.txt.
           exec - Optionally execute the remaining command line.
                   If specified, this must be the last razzle parameter
                   specified.  The remaining command line parameters are
                   then passed to command prompt as is.
         Enigma - Will turn on CSP signing and CSP signature checks in advapi
