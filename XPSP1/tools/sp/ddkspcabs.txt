     Usage: ddkspcabs.bat [-n <N>] [-f] [-l <language>] [-s] [-v]

     This tool requires a Razzle window.

     Generates CABs for the Kernelmode Development Kits.  N, which is
     optional, indicates the number of processes to start per processor.
     The default value is 2.

     By default, ddkspcabs.bat will exit early if the environment variable
     OFFICAL_BUILD_MACHINE is not defined.  To override this behavior,
     and for CAB generation, use -F.

     -L is used, and any language other than 'usa' is passed, CAB
     generation will not take place.

     -V turns on verbose mode.  See what cabs are being built.

     -S spoofs full postbuild. (DDKCabs.bat otherwise relies upon build_number.cmd)

     Dependencies:
     o The following environment variables are expected to be defined:
       %_NTDRIVE%, %_NTROOT%, %_BUILDARCH%, %_BUILDTYPE%, %_NTPOSTBLD%,
       %RazzleToolPath%, %NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS%, %TEMP%, and
       %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%.

     o The following directory trees are assumed to exist:
        1) %_NTPOSTBLD%\ddk_cd
        2) %_NTPOSTBLD%\ddk_flat
        3) %_NTPOSTBLD%\ifs_cd
        4) %_NTPOSTBLD%\ifs_flat
