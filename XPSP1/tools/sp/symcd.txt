Create Symbol CD.

SymCD [-l lang] [-m | -t]
  -l lang to specify which language
  -m      run only munge public
  -t      run all sections

If you define Official_Build_Machine, the script creates the cabs.
If not, the default does only munge public symbols.

For example, if you only want to munge public symbols on official
build machine, you can specify 'symcd.cmd /m'.

PS:
The 'Official_Build_Machine' is the environment variable to set 
to as a official build machine.
