    AUTO         "AUTO" delete builds based on the following priorities:
                    1.  Always delete from oldest to newest
                    2.  Never delete the newest <BuildsToKeep> builds
                    3.  Delete until <FreeReq> bytes are free, or until
                        no more builds can be deleted.      
                    4.  Perform partial deletes first.
                    4.  Perform full deletes only if all eligible builds are
                        partially deleted.
