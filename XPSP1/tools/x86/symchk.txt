NOTE:  This usage is subject to change in the next release.

Usage:  symchk [options] [/l] <file> /s <sympath> 

        symchk /m <ProcessId> /s <sympath>

        symchk /n <ExeName> /s <sympath>


    <file>           Name of file(s) or directory to check.
                     Can include wildcards.

    /l <file>       File that contains a list of files to check with one file
                    per line

    /m <ProcessId>  Check symbols for a process id

    /n <ExeName>    Check symbols for a loaded exe.

    /s <sympath>    Symbol path delimited by ;'s.  Checks <sympath>
                    and <sympath>\<ext> for each string in the path, 
                    where <ext> is the extension of the executable.

                    Symbol server paths are allowed.  See debugger documentation
                    for more details.  To retrieve symbols during symbol checking 
                    use the downstream store feature of symbol server.

    Options:        

    /b              Don't complain if there is no CodeView data

    /e <list>       File containing a list of files to not check symbols for.
                    This file can have one name per line. Comment lines begin
                    with a ; . 

    /f              Don't send symbol checking PASS/FAIL totals to the output

    /o              Verify that PDB files have some type information

    /p              Check that private information is removed from PDBs.

    /r              Recurse into subdirectories of the <file> argument.

    /t              Fails if the image points to a dbg file or if the image
                    contains data that can be stripped into a DBG file.

    /u              Fail if image points to a dbg file. Don't fail if image
                    contains data that can be split into a dbg file.

                    Default is the opposite:  fail if image contains data
                    that can be split into a dbg file and don't fail if image
                    points to a dbg file.

    /v              Give verbose information
