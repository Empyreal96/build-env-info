cleaninf.exe  Version 0.4

Cleans up an inf, html, or script file for public distribution or for packing
into a resource.  Without any options, this removes all comments.  This
tool recognizes .inf, .htm, .hta, .js and .htc files by default.

Syntax:  cleaninf [-w] [-inf | -htm | -js | -htc] sourceFile destFile

          -w     Strip whitespace

         These flags are mutually exclusive, and will treat the file
         accordingly, regardless of extension:
          -inf   Treat file as a .inf file
          -htm   Treat file as a .htm file
          -js    Treat file as a .js file
          -htc   Treat file as a .htc file
