# Usage = PopulateFromVBL.pl [-force] [-vbl=vblreleasedir] [-nttree=nttreedir] [-symbols]
#
# Function: Populate missing files in nttreedir from vblreleaseddir so
#   0) Verify that binplacedir and VBL are (compatible?) release directories
#   1) Find the binplace.log output for both paths
#   2) Figure out what projects were built in the nttree
#   3) Generate a list of files that were built on VBL for the projectlist
#   4) Output a list of files we should have built locally, but didn't
#   5) If (4) is empty, or -force, populate missing files in nttreedir
#      from vblreleaseedir forall projects
#
#   No files in nttreedir are overwritten from vblreleasedir
#   The checks for what should be there are not exact, because we rely only on
#   binplace.log entries -- and the VBL build may not exactly match the nttree build.
#
# [-force] -- do copying even if the nttree doesn't contain project files built in VBL
# [-verbose] -- chatter while working
# [-fake] -- don't do the actual copies
# [-checkbinplace] -- note VBL files that are in binplace.log but not build.binlist
# [-fulltargetok] -- run even if the target machine has built in all projects
#
#
# VBLpath will be computed from BuildMachines.txt if not supplied either
# on the command line, or in the VBL_RELEASE environment variable.
#
# If we are a build lab, we succeed without doing much.
