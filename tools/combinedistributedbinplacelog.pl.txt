#
#
# Usage: CombineDistributeBinplaceLogs.pl [-nttree=nttreedir] 
#
# Function: The distributed build process produces a unique binplace_%COMPUTERNAME%.log file
#           for each machine involved in the build.
#           This script combines them into a unified binplace.log file
#           translating the path information to coorespond to the local
#           enlistment.
#
#           If there are no files named binplace_*,log then this script exits silently.
