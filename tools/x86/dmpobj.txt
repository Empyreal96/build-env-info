DMPOBJ reads the contents of a specific section from
an OBJ image and emits its contents as a c-compatible
UCHAR array.

Usage: DMPOBJ <source> <secnam> <varnam>
where: <source> is the full path of the .obj file

       <secnam> is the name of the section to emit
                Use ENTIRE_FILE to dump the whole thing

       <varnam> is the name to assign to the array
