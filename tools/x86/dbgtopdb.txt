usage: dbgtopdb.exe [/strip] <exe-name> [/f /dbg <dbg-name>] [ <pdb-name> ]
        Move the debug information for this exe into a vc6 format pdb.
        /strip  Force the image to be stripped of debug info,
                even if security data is present.
        /f      Force reading symbols from the named .dbg and/or .pdb files,
                even if the timestamps or signatures do not match.
                If /f is present then the .pdb file name (and .dbg) must appear
                explicitly on the command line.
