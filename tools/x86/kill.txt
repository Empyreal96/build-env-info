usage: KILL [options] <<pid> | <pattern>>*

           [options]:
               -f     Force process kill

           <pid>
              This is the process id for the task
               to be killed.  Use TLIST to get a
               valid pid

           <pattern>
              The pattern can be a complete task
              name or a regular expression pattern
              to use as a match.  Kill matches the
              supplied pattern against the task names
              and the window titles.
