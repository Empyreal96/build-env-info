and scriptFile lines take any of the following forms:

    oldName newName
    "oldString" "newString"
    -F .Ext  Name.  Name.Ext

Where...
    oldName and newName following C Identifier rules
    oldString and newString are arbitrary text strings
    -F limits the munge to files that match:
        a particular extension (.Ext)
        a particular name (Name.)
        a particular name and extension (Name.Ext)
    If no -F line is seen in the scriptFile, then
    the following is the default:
    -F .asm .bat .c .cli .cpp .cxx .def .dlg .h .htm .hpj .hxx .idl .inc
    -F .inf .lic .mak .mc .odl .rc .rcv .reg .s .src .srv .tk .w .x
