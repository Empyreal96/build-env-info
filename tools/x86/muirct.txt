-h(elp) or -?    :  Show help screen.

-l(anguage)langid:  Extract only resource in this language.
                    The language resource must be specified. The value is in decimal.

-i(clude removed):  Include certain resource types,
resource_type          e.g. -i 2 3 4 or -i reginst avi 3 4 .
                    -i (to inlcude all resources).

-y               :  This is same with -k argument except it does not check

-o               :  This is same with -i argument except it does not check 
                    if the types are exist in the source file.

-z               :  Calculate and insert only checksum data to specific file

-p               :  Delete types from source file, but does not want to add into mui file 

-x               :  Add all resource types into MUI file as specified language id

-v(erbose) level :  Print all affected resource type, name, langID when level is 2.

source_filename  :  The localized source file (no wildcard support)

-e               :  CMF, the directory of matching execute file of compacted mui files 

-f               :  CMF, newly created CMF file name 
                 eg, muirct -m foo.dll.mui bar.dll.mui -f far.cmf -d c:\file\exe  

-d               :  CMF, dump CMF headers information
