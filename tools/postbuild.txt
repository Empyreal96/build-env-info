Usage: postbuild.cmd [-f -s -r -l lang][-?]
-l:lang   run for given language (see \codes.txt)
-full     run in forced non-incremental mode, i.e. run everything
          from scratch
-safe     run in incremental mode with extra sanity checks, e.g.
          force rebase and bind to run
-r        run incremental aggregation. 
          Applicable to international builds only.

postbuild.cmd is the general process to take a binaries tree and generate a
bootable image from it. it is incremental in the sense that it will
not run more than is needed on a second pass, and it is configurably
multithreaded. the user has two non-command line options for setting
preferences for compression and multithreading:

   HORSE_POWER   if this env var is set, the maximum number of threads
                 spawned by postbuild.cmd will be HORSE_POWER multiplied
                 by NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS. default is HORSE_POWER=2
   PB_COMP       if this env var is set to TRUE, compressed bootable
                 images will be generated regardless of the machine
                 postbuild.cmd is running on. if this env var is set to FALSE,
                 uncompressed images will be generated. the default is
                 to generate compressed images on quad-proc machines
                 or higher.

note that postbuild.cmd must be run from an NT razzle window with echo defined and existing.
