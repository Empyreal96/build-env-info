unicode [-l <language>]

Converts ansi files to unicode with unitext. The codepage to use for 
the conversion is looked up in tools\codes.txt. The list of files to 
convert is somewhat hardcoded. This script should be modified to use 
the data files tools\postbuildscripts\a2u*.txt as this is a 
replacement for a2u.pm.
