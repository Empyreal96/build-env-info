# build-env-info
I am not one to try compile the source properly..

But I did decide to try and document all the 'help' dialogue
and information from the scripts, executables, and other bits.

This won't be help to most, but to those messing around with the source:

Hopefully this comes handy, and I will try document all I can.. 
will take time though :)

so far: 
        /tools (root files in tools)
              /postbuildscripts
              /x86
