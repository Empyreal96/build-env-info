I am not the one to try compile the source properly or compile it for you..
I am not the one to distribute any Code or binaries to you..
Google and 4chan's god tier anons will help you if you need that.


I AM NOT THE ONE WHO MADE ANY GUIDES OR INSTRUCTIONS

THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL, RESEARCH PURPOSES AND ARCHIVIAL PURPOSES ONLY.
THERE ARE NO GUIDES HERE FROM ME.

I decided to try and document all the 'help' dialogue
and information from the scripts, executables, and other bits.

This won't be help to most, but to those messing around with the source:

Hopefully this comes handy, and I will try document all I can.. 
will take time though :)
