# build-env-info
I am not the one to try compile the source properly or for you..
I am not the one to distribute any Code or binaries to you..
THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL, RESEARCH PURPOSES AND ARCHIVIAL PURPOSES ONLY.
THERE ARE NO GUIDES HERE FROM ME.

I decideS to try and document all the 'help' dialogue
and information from the scripts, executables, and other bits.

This won't be help to most, but to those messing around with the source:

Hopefully this comes handy, and I will try document all I can.. 
will take time though :)

so far: 
        /tools (root files in tools)
              /postbuildscripts
              /x86
			  /sp
