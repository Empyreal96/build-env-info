SanityCheckUnicodeFiles.cmd

 Ensure that commonly messed up Unicode files have the proper "FFFE"
  Unicode signature on the front of the file.

 We read the list of files to sanity check from
  "C:\Win2K3\NT\tools\PostBuildScripts\SanityCheckList.txt".

  All paths we obtain are appended to "C:\Win2K3\NT\"
  to produce the final path to the file to be checked.
