	cmdevt.pl is a general process synchronization tool.
	Example use: let's say we want to start four threads
	and we want to make sure they don't finish before we
	begin listening for their exit. Then we just make sure
	that each thread begins with a call to cmdevt.pl -h EventN
	and finishes with a call to cmdevt.pl -s EventN.
	Meanwhile, our master thread can call cmdevt.pl -w Event1
	Event2 Event3 Event4. As soon as the master issues this,
	the slave threads will resume normal execution.
