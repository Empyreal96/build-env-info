Syntax:
	mtnmake.cmd [SYSGEN] -n <sessions> [-d] [-w <makefile>] [-v]

                 it's standard input / output file

sessions       : number of session you want to run at the same time.
-d             : do not make target directory tree (SYSGEN specific)
-v             : run verbosely, echo executed commands
makefile       : specify full path to makefile in order to run mtnmake.cmd
