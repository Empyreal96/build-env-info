newver.cmd
This script is for a special case when the build lab wants to
create daily incremental builds without doing a clean build.
This will keep the same build number, but generate a new build date,
and relink the kernels so that the new build date shows up.

Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

Run this before starting an incremental IDX build.
It updates the build date.
