#   FileName: sdrestore.cmd
#
#   Usage = sdrestore [-v] <backupdir>
#
#      This script does the converse of sdbackup by copying the saved files
#      from <backupdir> into the client's SD enlistments. All the files in 
#      <backupdir> will be checked out on the local machine and the backups
#      will be restored.
#
#      Currently this script bails out if any of the files in <backupdir> are
#      either already checked out or a different version than was backed up.
#      Clever diffing and merging could be done here instead.
