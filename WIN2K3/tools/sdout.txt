#   FileName: sdout.cmd
#
#   Usage = sdout [-v] [-o] filename...
#
#      This script allows for more graceful offline operation of SD. It tries
#      to run SD EDIT on the supplied filenames. If SD fails, then the file
#      is made writable and the filename is added to the sd.offline file in the
#      root of the depot. 
#
#      sdout with no arguments provides a list of the files which are currently
#      marked for offline editing.
#
#      Once network connectivity is restored, sdonline.cmd will cleanup the 
#      sd.offline files and check the files out properly.
