# FileName: PopFilter.pl
#
# Script for building Windows .Net Server builds and XP Client SP1 together.
# Have any changes to this file reviewed by DavePr, BryanT, or BPerkins before checking in.
#
# Usage = PopFilter.pl [-fake]
# Usage = PopFilter.pl [-fake] [-vbl=vblreleasedir] [-xpsp1=xpsp1dir] [-nttree=nttreedir] [-nocompare]
#
# Function: Populate missing files in nttreedir from vblreleaseddir so
#   1) Find the XPSP1 directory, searching under
#       xpsp1dir
#       SDXROOT\..
#       VBL_RELEASE
#       \\winbuilds\release\main\usa
#      And read in the Version information and the GoldTimestamps
#   2) Read in SDXROOT\dbdir\LockedDB and parse into several piles:
#           CheckFiles   -- non-PE files that should be found to be completely unchanged -- measured by
#                           an external date/size/checksum.  .inf files are checked for size/date after
#                           removing the DriverVer= line  This check probably will just say UNICODE INFs miscompare.
#           CheckPEFiles -- PE files that should be found to be completely unchanged -- measured by
#                           an internal date/checksum.
#           PEReplaceFiles -- PE files that are expected to have been re-built, but should be the same as measured
#                           by xpsp1compdir /i /b /y  [someday just /y].
#   3) Check CheckFiles unless -nocompare.
#   4) Check CheckPEFiles unless -nocompare.
#   5) Check PEReplaceFiles against XPSP1\Reference\* -- unless -nocompare or CHK or ClientSDXRoot in version != SDXROOT
#   6) Pick a source directory for PEReplaceFiles according to the following algorithm
#       XPSP1\Checked    -- if this is a checked build, and this directory exists
#       XPSP1\Gold       -- if this directory exists
#       XPSP1\Reference  -- otherwise
#   7) Replace files (unless check said not to).
#
# [-verbose] -- chatter while working
# [-fake] -- don't actually make any changes
# [-force] -- force copies even if errors on comparisons -- but miscompares never copied
# [-filter] -- copy over the files from the client if no mismatches or -force
# [-nofilter] -- do not copy over the client files (kind of an official -fake).  The default is $NoFilter -- for now.
# [-test] -- hook for special testing
#
# [-nodates] -- turn off date comparisons in non-PE files and rely on size and checksum
