movelatest.cmd [-l:<lang>][-f]

-l:<lang>   language; default is usa.
-f          issues net stop server, performs move, and restarts service

MoveLatest.cmd moves the latest release directory to a binaries directory.
This needs to be done before taking an incremental fix after running
postbuild.cmd. If MoveLatest.cmd fails, try again using the -f switch.
