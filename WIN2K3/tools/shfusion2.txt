# This Perl program generates the "IsolationAware" stubs
# in winbase.inl, winuser.inl, prsht.h, commctrl.h, commdlg.h.
#
# It is run by the makefile.inc files in
#   base\published
#   windows\published
#   shell\published\inc
#
# The name "shfusion2" comes from these stubs being the public replacement
# for "shfusion" -- shell\lib\shfusion.
#
# Generation of the stubs is driven by declarations in the .w files.
# The stubs vary in a few ways.
#   Some are just for delayload purposes -- all the actctx functions.
#   Some delayload the entire .dll -- comctl32.dll.
#   Others activate around static links -- kernel32.dll, user32.dll, comdlg32.dll
#   some do not activate at all -- the actctx functions
#   winbase.inl gets an extra chunk of "less generated" / "relatively hardcoded"
#      code, that the stubs in the other files depend on.
#      winbase.inl exports two symbols to all the stubs, and one extra symbol
#        to two stubs in prsht.h
#      The two symbols are ActivateMyActCtx, g_fDownlevel.
#      The third symbol is g_hActCtx.
#      All symbols get "mangled".
#   Each header also gets a small function for calling GetProcAddress with an implied
#     HMODULE parameter. This function's name is also "mangled".
#   Besides "mangling", all external symbols are clearly "namespaced" with a relatively
#     long "namespace" -- IsolationAware or IsolationAwarePrivate.
