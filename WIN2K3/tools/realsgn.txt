realsgn.cmd  -	This is a utility to sign test binaries
	     	against a real signed build. It copies
	     	the correct "testsign" infs, testroot,
	     	and catalog file from \\ntbuilds\release;
	     	updates and signs the catalog; and checks
	     	that the files are signed.

USAGE: realsgn buildnumber architecture dbgtype ostype directory

       E.G. - realsgn 2000 x86 fre wks c:\mydir
	       
		buildnumber - must be a build number on DFS
		architecute - x86 or alpha
		debugtype   - fre or chk
		ostype      - wks or per or bla or sbs or srv or ent or dtc
	        directory   - the absolute path to the directory
			      containing your test bits.

       THESE PARAMETERS MUST BE IN THE CORRECT ORDER	  

PREREQUISITES -	You must have the following tools in your path:
			chktrust.exe
			signcode.exe
			updcat.exe
			driver.spc
			driver.pvk
ECHO is off.

	      - Installed testroot.cer:
			To install the testroot, copy
			testroot.cer from the fre.pub\tools
			directory of \\ntbuilds\release\usa.
			Expand it. Run it from a command prompt.
			A wizard will guide through a very quick
			installation. Once there, it will remain
			until you upgrade to a PRS signed build.
