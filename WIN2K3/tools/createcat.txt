createcat -f <filelist> -c <catfile> -t <tempdir> -o <outdir> [-a <osattr>] [-l <language>]

Creates a CAT file signed with the test certificate
given a file with the proper list format for a CDF.

-f <filelist>  Specifies the file listing the files to be put
               into the CAT file.  Each file needs to be listed
               on a separate line as follows:

               <hash>path\filename=path\filename

-c <catfile>   Specifies the name of the catalog file, with
               no extension.
-t <tempdir>   Specifies the temporary directory to use when
               creating the CAT and CDF files.
-o <outdir>    Specifies the directory to place the final
               CAT and CDF files.
-a <osattr>    Specifies the OSAttr used in CDF's CATATTR1 entry.
               2:5.0 is the default value, correct for Win2k files.
               Use 1:4.0 for Win98 files, and 2:4.x for NT4 SP files.
