      Deltacat.cmd [q] [5.0] [/f text file with extra catalog attributes] <path to bins>

      [/q] [-q] Quiet mode
      [/5.0] [-5.0] Nt 5 version - NT 5.2 is default
      [/5.1] [-5.1] Nt 5.1 version - NT 5.2 is default
      <path to bins> FULL PATH to bins. Do not run in bins directory.


      Creates a catalog file, "delta.cat" for files in the directory
      passed as input. For example: If you have ntoskrnl.exe and pci.sys
      in a directory "d:\BINARIES," running "deltacat d:\BINARIES"
      will create a delta.cat and place it in the d:\BINARIES directory.

      Then to setup test your binaries use the /m switch with winnt32
      get your binaries and catalog file from d:\BINARIES. For example,
      run \\ntubilds\release\usa\latest.tst\x86\fre.wks\winnt32
      \winnt32.exe /m:d:\BINARIES.

      IF you have either LAYOUT.INF or SYSSETUP.INF
      in your signing directory. Deltacat will not
      sign these files which must be signed in nt5inf.cat.

      Let deltacat run then do the following:
      1. Copy nt5inf.ca_ to your signing directory
         from wherever your are installing, e.g.
         \\ntbuilds\release\usa\latest.tst\x86\fre.wks,
         or, e.g. e:\i386.
      2. Make sure you have the most recent updcat.exe
        in your C:\WINDOWS\idw directory
      3. Run infsign.cmd
      4. Then run winnt32 with /m:signing directory
