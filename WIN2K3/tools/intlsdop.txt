Perform Integrate, reverse integrate or sync for internatioanl builds steps. 


Usage:
    intlsdop.cmd [-l:<lang> | -d:<location>] -o:<op> [-t:<timestamp>][-pf] [-y:<branch>] [-c]

    -l Language. Default is "usa".

       The operation intlsdop.cmd performs is language dependent. 
       Not all op/lang combinations are allowed.

       If "usa",  sync the source projects under SDXROOT.
       If <lang>, RI or sync the localization projects for the given <lang>.
			
    -d: Location.
	This could be %sdxroot% or %RazzleToolPath%
	Perform sd <operation> on <location>.
        
    -o: SD operation.
		if "r", perform loc RI.
		if "s", perform sync.
		if "v", perform verification.
		if "u", perform updates. This option is not yet functional.

    -t Timestamp. Used for Integrate/RI/syncing the SD files.
       Default is the latest time.

    -f: Force operation

    -i: Interactive mode (prompts for user input) 

    -p Powerless.
       Do not perform sd operation.

    -y <branch>  the branch parameter which defaults to "locpart". 
    
    -c Force sync to current, It only works when used with -d:%RazzleToolPath%

    intlsdop.cmd -d:%sdxroot% -t:2000/10/01:18:00 -o:s
    	Sync the source tree at the given timestamp.

    intlsdop.cmd -l:ger -t:2000/09/09:12:34 -o:r
	Reverse integrate German localization projects at the given timestamp.

    intlsdop.cmd -l:JPN -t:2000/09/09:12:34 -o:r -y:dnsrv_dev
	Reverse integrate Japanese localization projects from dnsrv_dev 
        to dnsrv at the given timestamp.
