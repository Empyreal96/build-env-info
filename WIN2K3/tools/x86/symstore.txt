Usage:
symstore add [/r] [/p] [/l] /f File /s Store /t Product [/v Version]
             [/c Comment] [/d LogFile]

symstore add [/r] [/p] [/l] /g Share /f File /x IndexFile [/a] [/d LogFile]

symstore add /y IndexFile /g Share /s Store [/p] /t Product [/v Version]
             [/c Comment] [/d LogFile]

symstore del /i ID /s Store [/d LogFile]

    add             Add files to server or create an index file.

    del             Delete a transaction from the server.

    /f File         Network path of files or directories to add.

    /g Share        This is the server and share where the symbol files were
                    originally stored.  When used with /f, Share should be
                    identical to the beginning of the File specifier.  When
                    used with the /y, Share should be the location of the
                    original symbol files, not the index file.  This allows
                    you to later change this portion of the file path in case
                    you move the symbol files to a different server and share.

    /i ID           Transaction ID string.

    /l              Allows the file to be in a local directory rather than a
                    network path.(This option is only used with the /p option.)

    /p              Causes SymStore to store a pointer to the file, rather than
                    the file itself.

    /r              Add files or directories recursively.

    /s Store        Root directory for the symbol store.

    /t Product      Name of the product.

    /v Version      Version of the product.

    /c Comment      Comment for the transaction.

    /d LogFile      Send output to LogFile instead of standard output.

    /x IndexFile    Causes SymStore not to store the actual symbol files in the
                    symbol store.  Instead, information is stored which will
                    allow the files to be added later.

    /y IndexFile    This reads the data from a file created with /x.

    /yi IndexFile   Append a comment with the transaction ID to the end of the
                    index file.

    /a              Causes SymStore to append new indexing information
                    to an existing index file. (This option is only used with
                    /x option.)

    /o              Give verbose output.
