fcopy [options] [@response] [[-s] source[=rename] ...] destination

  Options:  -l -g -t -a -b -w -e -z -d -f -m -v -3 -5 -8

  Multiple sources can be specified (order preserved, alphabetically sorted
  within wildcard specifiers).  Destination may be floppy drive (A:, B:), or
  the name of a floppy image file to create.  A response file (@filename) can
  be used to specify options rather than lengthy command line.  Environment
  variables are expanded in the response file same as command line.  Rename
  specifier can be full or partial target path and/or filename.

  Common options:

    -l  volume label (e.g. -l DISK1)
    -g  create zero-length tagfile in root directory (e.g. -g DISK1)
    -t  time stamp for all files month/day/year/hour/minute/second
          (no spaces, e.g. -t 12/31/91,15:01:00)
    -a  copy file attributes vs. ignoring hidden files/directories
    -b  boot sector specifier, can be filename or one of hardcoded:
          "DOS" (MS-DOS 5.0, default), "NT31SETUP", "NT35SETUP",
          or "NT35NEC98SETUP"
    -w  (DMF only) mark target as writable versus write-protected
    -s  include subdirectories for next source specifier
    -e  include empty subdirectories as well (for all sources)
    -x  specify a subdirectory on the target for subsequent files
          (e.g. put subsequent files in i386 directory: -x i386)

  Options when destination is a physical floppy disk:
    -z  zero-fill unused sectors vs. only writing necessary sectors
    -d  double-write mode writes each sector twice
    -f  format target disk prior to writing data (standard format)
    -m  format target 3.5" HD floppy with 1.7MB DMF format
    -v  verify (read and compare) destination after writing

  Options when destination is a floppy image file:
    -3  specify target is 3.5" HD 1.44MB floppy (default)
    -5  specify target is 5.25" HD 1.2MB floppy
    -8  specify target is 3.5" HD 1.7MB DMF floppy
