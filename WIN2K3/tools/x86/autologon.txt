AUTOLOGON v1.00 : (c) 2001, Microsoft Corporation

DESCRIPTION:
   Used to configure encrypted autologon functionality

USAGE:
   AUTOLOGON [/?] [/Quiet] [/Migrate] [/Delete] [/Set]
             [/Username:username] [/Count:count]
    Options:
      /?         Display complete help documentation
      /Quiet     Enable quiet mode, which supresses all output
      /Migrate   Migrate cleartext password from registry to LSASecret
      /Delete    Deletes the default password and disable AutoAdminLogon 
      /Set       Set the DefaultPassword LSASecret and enable AutoAdminLogon
      /Username  The username to set in Default UserName.
      /Count     Set the logoncount

NOTES:
    1.The /Migrate /Delete /Set commands are exclusive.
      You will always be prompted for a password.
      If a username is not specified the currently logged on user is assumed.
      If no count is specified a count of 0 is implicitely assumed.

    2.You need to be running as a member of the local administrators group for
      this utility to work properly.

    3.When setting a password that has special characters in it, such as "|>&
      make sure that you escape these characters. Also, passwords with spaces 
      should be enclosed in double quotes.

    4.Setting the logoncount to 0 means an autologon will be performed until
      the secret is deleted.
