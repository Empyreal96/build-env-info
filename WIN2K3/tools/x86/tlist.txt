           <pid>
              List module information for this task.

           <pattern>
              The pattern can be a complete task
              name or a regular expression pattern
              to use as a match.  Tlist matches the
              supplied pattern against the task names
              and the window titles.

           -m <pattern>
              Lists all tasks that have DLL modules loaded
              in them that match the given pattern name

           -s
              Show services active in each process.

           -p <processname>
              Returns the PID of the process specified or -1
              if the specified process doesn't exist.  If there
              are multiple instances of the process running only
              the instance with the first PID value is returned.
