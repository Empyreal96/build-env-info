This program has two purposes surrounding XML and the Catalog:                 
        1)  Validating XML File - This is useful for any XML file whether      
            related to Catalog or not.                                         
        2)  Compiling - This refers to the Compiling of Catalog Meta and Wiring
            into the following files: An Unmanaged C++ Header, The Catalog XML 
            Schema (xms) file and The Catalog Dynamic Link Library.            
                                                                               
CatUtil [/?] [Validate] [/Compile] [/meta=[CatMeta.xml]] [/wire=[CatWire.xml]] 
        [/header=[CatMeta.h]] [/schema=[Catalog.xms]] [/dll=[Catalog.dll]]     
        [/mbmeta=[MBMeta.xml]] [xmlfilename]                                   
                                                                               
? - Brings up this help screen.                                                
                                                                               
validate - Will indicate whether the given file is 'Valid' according to its DTD
        or XML Schema.  This requires an 'xmlfilename'.                        
                                                                               
xmlfilename - If specified with no other options, the XML file will be checked 
        for 'Well-Formity'.                                                    
                                                                               
product - Associates the dll with the given product name.  The Product Name    
        must be supplied.  This association MUST be done before the Catalog may
        be used with the given product.                                        
                                                                               
compile - Compile of Catalog Meta and Wiring as described above, using deaults 
        where no values are supplied.  To do a partial compile (ie only        
        generate the Unmanaged C++ Header) do NOT specify the 'Compile' option 
        and only specify the 'meta' and 'header' options.  'Compile' is the    
        same as '/meta /wire /header /schema /dll' where any of those flags    
        explicitly specified may override the defaults.                        
                                                                               
mbmeta - Specifies the Metabase Meta XML file.  The default is MBMeta.xml.     
             This is an input only file and will not be modified               
meta   - Specifies the Catalog Meta XML file.  The default is CatMeta.xml.     
             This is an input only file and will not be modified               
wire   - Specifies the Catalog Wiring XML file.  The default is CatWire.xml.   
             This is an input only file and will not be modified               
header - Specifies the Unmanaged C++ Header file.  The default is CatMeta.h.   
             This is an input/output file and will be updated only if changed. 
schema - Specifies the Catalog XML Schema file.  The default is Catalog.xms.   
             This is an output file and will overwrite a previous version.     
dll    - Specifies the Catalog DLL file.  The default is Catalog.dll.          
             This is an input/output file and will update the previous version.
             Either the 'compile' or 'product' option must be specified along  
             with the 'dll' option.                                            
config - Specifies the Machine Config Directory.                               
             The 'product' option must be specified along with the 'config'    
             option.                                                           
verbose - This generates detailed output about the compilation
