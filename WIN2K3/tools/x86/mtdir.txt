mtdir.exe: Looking for empty SubDirectories

A directory is treated as empty if it has no file or directory in it.  In any
case, a directory is not empty if it has file.
Available switches are:
    /d:    directory is also listed empty if it only has SubDirectory in it
    /e:    acutally perform deletions of empty directories
    /v:    Verbose
    /?:    prints this message
