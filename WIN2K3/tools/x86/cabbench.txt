CabBench performs high-level operations on CAB files, such as merging
two or more existing cabinets into one.

Usage: CabBench {script}

Script commands may be completely supplied on the command line, or an
inline @file may be used.  The inline file may include semicolon-prefixed
comments.

CabBench scripts operate somewhat like an RPN calculator:

  load {filename.cab}  ;add filename.cab to top of stack.
  save {filename.cab}  ;write top-most cabinet to filename.cab.
  merge                ;merge top-most cabinet into next top-most.
  mergefile <filename> ;add filename to last cabinet in stack.
  unload               ;pop one cabinet from the stack.
  swap                 ;exchange top two cabinets on stack.
  set {attribute}      ;set an attribute of the top cabinet.

Example:

  C> CabBench load cab1.cab load cab2.cab merge save cab3.cab

Merges all entries in cab2.cab into cab1.cab.  cab2.cab files replace
any cab1.cab files by the same name.  Save merged results to cab3.cab.

Attributes:

  preserve_file_order  ;for Darwin 1.x only (use just after load)
  setid=####           ;set this cabinet's internal ID
