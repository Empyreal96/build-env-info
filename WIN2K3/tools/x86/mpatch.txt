Usage:  MPATCH [options] OldFile[;OldFile2[;OldFile3]] NewFile TargetPatchFile

        Options:

          -NOBINDFIX   Turn off automatic compensation for bound imports in
                       the the old file.  The default is to ignore binding
                       data in the old file during patch creation which will
                       cause the application of the patch to succeed whether
                       or not the old file on the target machine is bound, not
                       bound, or even bound to different import addresses.
                       If the files are not Win32 binaries, this option is
                       ignored and has no effect.

          -NOLOCKFIX   Turn off automatic compensation for smashed lock prefix
                       instructions.  If the files are not Win32 binaries,
                       this option is ignored and has no effect.

          -NOREBASE    Turn off automatic internal rebasing of old file to new
                       file's image base address.  If the files are not Win32
                       binaries, this option is ignored and has no effect.

          -NORESTIME   Turn off automatic fixup of resource section timestamps
                       (ignored if not Win32 binaries).

          -NOSTORETIME Don't store the timestamp of the new file in the patch
                       file.  Instead, set the timestamp of the patch file to
                       the timestamp of the new file.

          -IGNORE:Offset,Length[,FileNumber]

                       Ignore a range of bytes in the OldFile because those
                       bytes might be different in the old file being patched
                       on the target machine.

          -RETAIN:Offset,Length[,OffsetInNewFile[,FileNumber]]

                       When applying the patch, preserve the range of bytes in
                       the old file and copy them to the new file at the given
                       OffsetInNewFile.

          -FAILBIGGER  If patch file is bigger than simple compressed file,
                       don't create the patch file (takes longer).

          -FAILIFSAME  If old and new files are the same (ignoring binding
                       differences, etc), don't create the patch file.

          -NOCOMPARE   Don't compare patch compression against ordinary non-
                       patch compression (saves time).

          -NOPROGRESS  Don't display percent complete while building patch.

          -NEWSYMPATH:PathName[;PathName]

                       For NewFile, search for symbol file(s) in these path
                       locations (recursive search each path until found).
                       The default is to search for symbol files(s) starting
                       in the same directory as the NewFile.

          -OLDSYMPATH:PathName[;PathName][,FileNumber]

                       For OldFile, search for symbol file(s) in these path
                       locations (recursive search each path until found).
                       The default is to search for symbol files(s) starting
                       in the same directory as the OldFile.

          -UNDECORATED After matching decorated symbol names, match remaining
                       symbols using undecorated names.

          -NOSYMS      Don't use debug symbol files when creating the patch.

          -NOSYMFAIL   Don't fail to create patch if symbols cannot be loaded.

          -NOSYMWARN   Don't warn if symbols can't be found or don't match the
                       corresponding file (symbol checksum mismatch).

          -USEBADSYMS  Rather than ignoring symbols if the checksums don't
                       match the corresponding files, use the bad symbols.

          -E8          Force E8 call translation for x86 binaries.

          -NOE8        Force no E8 call translation for x86 binaries.

                       If neither -E8 or -NOE8 are specified, and the files
                       are x86 binaries, the patch will be built internally
                       twice and the smaller will be chosen for output.

          -MSPATCH194COMPAT  Assure the patch file can be used with version
                       1.94 of MSPATCH*.DLL.  May increase size of patch
                       file if old or new file is larger than 4Mb.

          MPATCH will also look for environment variables named "MPATCH"
          followed by an underscore and the name of the option.  Command line
          specified options override environment variable options.  Examples:

              MPATCH_NOCOMPARE=1
              MPATCH_NEWSYMPATH=c:\winnt\symbols;\\server\share\symbols
