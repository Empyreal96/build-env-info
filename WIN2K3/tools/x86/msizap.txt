       msizap *[A!] ALLPRODUCTS
       msizap PSA?!

       * = remove all Windows Installer folders and regkeys;
           adjust shared DLL counts; stop Windows Installer service
       T = remove all info for given product code
       P = remove In-Progress key
       S = remove Rollback Information
       A = for any specified removal, just change ACLs to Admin Full Control
       W = for all users (by default, only for the current user)
       G = remove orphaned cached Windows Installer data files (for all users)

         function after using msizap
