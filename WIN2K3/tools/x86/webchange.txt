Usage: webchange <URL with query string> <temp filename>

If the temp file is a "pending" or "new" Source Depot changelist:
	WebChange opens the specified web page and fills in the hash of the
	file to complete the query string. The web page should host the
	WebChangelistEditor ActiveX control, which can be initialized with the
	given hash to edit the changelist.
If the temp file is anything else:
	WebChange calls %SDALTFORMEDITOR% with the name of the temp file.

Example: webchange http://ntserver/submit.asp?key= d:\temp\t3104t1.tmp
