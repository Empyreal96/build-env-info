symchk [/r] [/q] [Input options] <Filename> /s <SymbolPath> [options]

<Filename>      Name of the file or directory that contains the executables
                to perform symbol checking on.

/s <SymbolPath> Semi-colon separated list of symbol paths.  Symbol server
                paths are allowed.  To retrieve symbols to a downstream
                store, use "SRV*<downstream store>*<symbol server>" for
                the symbol path.  See the debugger documentation for more
                details.

/r              Perform recursive operations on the <Filename> specified.  The
                wildcard * can be used in filenames.

/q              Turn off all output options by default. Only output turned on
                with a output flag (see below) will be printed

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Input options (choose only one):
/if <Filename>       Input is a file name.  Wildcards can be used to specify
                     the file name. Default if nothing is specified.
/id <DumpFile>       Input is a dump file.
/ie <ExeName>        Input is an application name that is currently running.
/ip <ProcessId>      Input is a process id.
/it <TextFileList>   Input is a list of files, one per line, inside of a text
                     file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Action options (choose only one):
/av  For each binary, Verify symbols exist and match.  Default.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Symbol checking options:
/cs  Skip verifying that there is CodeView data. Symchk will verify that there
     IS codeview data by default.
/cn  When symbol checking a running process, don't suspend that process.  User
     must ensure the process doesn't exit before symbol checking finishes.

- Symbol checking options for DBG information (choose one):
/ds  If image was built so that there is information that belongs in a DBG
     file, then this option verifies that the DBG information is stripped
     from the image and that the image points to a DBG file. Default.
/de  If image was built so that there is information that belongs in a DBG
     file, then this option verifies that the DBG information is STILL in the
     image and that the image does not point to a DBG file.
/dn  Verify that the image does not point to a DBG file and that DBG
     information is not in the image.

- Symbol checking options for PDB files:
/pa  Allow both public and private PDBs.  Default.
/pf  Verify that PDB files contain full source information.
/ps  Verify that PDB files are stripped and do not contain full source
     (private) information.
/pt  Verify that PDB files are stripped, but do have type information.  Some
     PDB files may be stripped but have type information added back in.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Symbol checking exclude options:
/ea <Filename>  Don't perform symbol checking for the binaries listed in the
                file specified.  <Filename> is a text file that contains the
                name of each binary, one per line.
/ee <Filename>  Perform symbol checking and report files that pass or are
                ignored, but don't report errors for binaries listed in the
                file specified.  <Filename> is a text file that contains the
                name of each binary, one per line.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Symbol path options (choose one):
/s  <SymbolPath>  None of the /s options are turned on.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Output options (choose all that apply):
/ob    Give the full path for binaries in the output messages for symbol
       checking.
/od    List all details.  Same as /oe /op /oi
/oe    List individual errors.  Errors will be sent to the output by default.
       This option is only needed when using /q
/oi    List each file that is ignored.
/op    List each file that passes.
/os    Give the full path for symbols in the output messages for symbol
       checking.
/ot    Send totals to the output.  Totals are sent to the output by default.
       This option is only needed when using /q
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Misc options
 /port     Old usage to new usage quick porting table
 *** This option is only temporary while everyone gets use to the new syntax
