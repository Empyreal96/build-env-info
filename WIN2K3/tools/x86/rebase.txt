usage: REBASE [switches]
              [-R image-root [-G filename] [-O filename] [-N filename]]
              image-names...

              One of -b and -i switches are mandatory.

              [-a] Does nothing
              [-b InitialBase] specify initial base address
              [-c coffbase_filename] generate coffbase.txt
                  -C includes filename extensions, -c does not
              [-d] top down rebase
              [-e SizeAdjustment] specify extra size to allow for image growth
              [-f] Strip relocs after rebasing the image
              [-i coffbase_filename] get base addresses from coffbase_filename
              [-l logFilePath] write image bases to log file.
              [-p] Does nothing
              [-q] minimal output
              [-s] just sum image range
              [-u symbol_dir] Update debug info in .DBG along this path
              [-v] verbose output
              [-x symbol_dir] Same as -u
              [-z] allow system file rebasing
              [-?] display this message

              [-R image_root] set image root for use by -G, -O, -N
              [-G filename] group images together in address space
              [-O filename] overlay images in address space
              [-N filename] leave images at their origional address
                  -G, -O, -N, may occur multiple times.  File "filename"
                  contains a list of files (relative to "image-root")

              'image-names' can be either a file (foo.dll) or files (*.dll)
                            or a file that lists other files (@files.txt).
                            If you want to rebase to a fixed address (ala QFE)
                            use the @@files.txt format where files.txt contains
                            address/size combos in addition to the filename
