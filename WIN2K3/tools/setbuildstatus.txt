SetBuildStatus.cmd -s:stage [-n:buildnumber] [-l:lang]

 Call SetBuildStatus.vbs with the proper data to record the
  build status in the status database. Only runs for official
  builds.

 -s:buildstage   Build Stage. Must be one of the ones below. Note
                 that "done" and "scrub" are mutually exclusive
                 for a given build of a lang and archtype.
                     build
                     postbuild
                     boot
                     bvt
                     release
                     done
                     scrub
 -n:buildnum     Build number. Must be a full build number in the
                  form "number.archtype.branch.date". If one is not
                  provided, we will attempt to use the value from
                  the first one of these that we can find it from:
                    %SDXROOT%\BuildName.txt
                    %_NTPOSTBUILD%\build_logsBuildName.txt
                    %_NTTREE%\build_logsBuildName.txt
 -l:language     Any valid language from codes.txt. Default is USA.


 Note that this tool is designed to be run during automated build
  processes and any problems it encounters are not output as
  errors - not reporting build status is not a build blocking
  issue. This script should never output something that says
  "ERROR: xxxx", but instead simply output the relevant information
  about what happened so it will be logged for later use.
