         IF you have either LAYOUT.INF or SYSSETUP.INF
         in your signing directory. Deltacat will not
         sign these files which must be signed in nt5inf.cat.

         Let deltacat run then do the following:
         1. Copy nt5inf.ca_ to your signing directory
            from wherever your are installing, e.g.
            \\ntbuilds\release\usa\latest.tst\x86\fre.wks,
            or, e.g. e:\i386.
         2. Make sure you have the most recent updcat.exe
         3. Run infsign [directory], e.g. infsign c:\bin

         When complete, run winnt32 /m:[directory]
